* After vagrant up, everything is set automatically, and takes ~5-10 minutes depending on network speed 
  (dependencies installation is done via yum repos, everything else takes slightly less time)

* Project was tested on RHEL7.2, RHEL7.3 and Fedora22
  Ansible 2.2.0.0
  Vagrant 1.9.0

* To run stress test:

 cd to testapp/ and execute:
 ./doconn.sh
 that will send 20000 requests to 127.0.0.1:1337
 
 Detailed description is available in ./testapp/README.md file. Usage is available by executing ./doconn.sh -h

 One host is monitored, 3  metrics are used besides regular OS monitors:

	1. "More than 50 error messages in application log" - is monitoring /opt/application/err.log and if found more than 50 error messages, will provide critical alarm
	2. "Way too many connections" - is monitoring /opt/application/conn.log and triggers an warning if there are more than 100 connection lines in last few minutes
	3. "No new connections" - checking that no new lines appear in /opt/application/conn.log and triggers warning. 

 NB: check_logfile plugin is used, and it is set in a default way, if after check situation is changed (ie no new error messages, alarm will disapear)
