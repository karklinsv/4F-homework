* After vagrant up, everything is set automatically, and takes ~5-10 minutes depending on network speed 
  (dependencies installation is done via yum repos, everything else takes slightly less time)

* Project was tested on RHEL7.2 and Fedora22
  Ansible 2.2.0.0
  Vagrant 1.9.0

* To run stress test:

 from same directory where script is located execute:
 ./doconn.sh
 that will send 20000 requests to 127.0.0.1:1337
 
 Detailed descritption is available in README file. Usage is available by executing ./doconn.sh -h


* Monitoring system:

 Nagios is running on: 127.0.0.1:9119/nagios/  (Please note, last "/" is necessary, I have tried multiple solutions to get rid of it, but currently unsuccessfully)
 https:// is used, but automatical redirect is working is You access http://

 Credentials:
	nagiosadmin
	horsie123

 Only one host is monitored, 3  metrics are used besides regular OS monitors:
	1. "More than 50 error messages in application log" - is monitoring /opt/application/err.log and if found more than 50 error messages, will provide critical alarm
	2. "Way too many connections" - is monitoring /opt/application/conn.log and triggers an warning if there are more than 100 connection lines in last few minutes
	3. "No new connections" - checking that no new lines appear in /opt/application/conn.log and triggers warning. 

 NB: check_logfile plugin is used, and it is set in a way, that if after check situation is changed (ie no new error messages, alarm will disapear)

* Vagrant project:

 Consist of Vagrantfile and centos7.box file (CentOS7 Minimal)
 Also includes Ansible project, which is executed on vagrant up (set up monitoring, application, httpd and nginx, all dependencies)
